		       The ocaml-expat library

Overview

  Ocaml-Expat is a wrapper for the Expat XML parsing library. Expat is
  a library, written in C, for parsing XML documents. It's the
  underlying XML parser for the open source Mozilla project, Perl's
  XML::Parser, Python's xml.parsers.expat, and other open-source XML
  parsers.

Installation

  - Edit the variables at the beginning of the Makefile to reflect the
    location where expat is installed on your system. The defaults are
    ok for Linux.

  - Do "make depend" and "make all"

  - If the Objective Caml native-code compiler is available on your
    platform (look for the "ocamlopt" executable), do "make allopt".

  - To generate the documentation, do "make doc"

  - (Optional) To test the library, do "make test". This requires the
    installation of OUnit.

  - (Optional) To test the library compiled with ocamlopt and ocamlc,
    do "make testall". This requires the installation of OUnit.

  - Become super-user if necessary and do "make install".  This
    installs the library in the standard Objective Caml library
    directory.
